# Summary
A simple C library and demo examples reading angular data from EMS22a50 for STM32F1xx devices.

The library uses SPI protocol to communicate with the sensor and is built on-top of the STM32F1xx HAL Drivers. It stores the encoder data into a struct object and the included functions are for initilization and for reading the data. 

Examples are included on how to communicate with the encoder with the library.
