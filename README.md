# Summary
A simple C library and demo examples reading angular data from EMS22a50 for STM32F1xx devices.

The library uses SPI protocol to communicate with the sensor and is built on-top of the STM32F1xx HAL Drivers. It stores the encoder data into a struct object and features other functions that are relevant with handling encoder data such as getting the total revolutions and rotations.

Examples are included on how to communicate with the encoder with the library.
